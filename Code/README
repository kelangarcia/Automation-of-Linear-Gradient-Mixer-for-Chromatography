Three files are included:
Two gradient mixer codes and needed libraries. 

- Needed Libraries: The necessary libraries are ready to drag and drop to Arduino libraries folder. Make sure they are not updated to not cause any compatibility issues. 
- "Original Code/GradientMixer/GradientMixer.ino": Original Gradient Mixer Code.
- "LCD Inverted Code/Gradient_Mixer/Gradient_Mixer.ino":  If you notice that when there is a press in the touch screen it detects the touch but in the inverted y-axis position, then upload the second code (LCD inverted  code)
